                     make delicious recipes out of them. Furthermore, there are not a lot of <br />
                     free apps that allow people to save their own recipes, find recipes, <br />
                     adjust serving sizes, and see nutritional facts.

                     a mobile application that works with both Android and iOS. Our app will <br />
                     have to be able to store data locally. If possible, we also want people <br />
                     to be able to view recipes that other users submit as well, which would <br />
                     require that we store that information.
